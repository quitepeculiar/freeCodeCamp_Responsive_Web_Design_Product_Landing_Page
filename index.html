        <h3>About Us</h3>

        <h3>Volunteer With Us</h3>
        <p>We are incredibly grateful to all of the volunteers we have had to make our festivals be incredibly fun and successful fundraising events.</p>
<p>If you would like to be involved in volunteering for our next event, please watch this space for future announcements of opportunities to be part of the team. Volunteers help us donate as much money as possible to our partner charities, and we’re thrilled to say we’ve had many repeat volunteers helping out over the years--you know who you are!</p>

          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>It has been quite a while since our last festival, Love Beer London, and even longer since our eponymous festival, Craft Beer Cares. We’ve missed everyone, and can’t wait to announce our next major event.</p>
          <p>Our next festival is currently a work in progress, and we are looking at dates for a 2022 beery bash with a focus on fundraising for great causes.</p>
          <p>We may hold some other smaller events prior to one of our signature festivals, so please keep an eye on our website, social media, and your inbox if you’ve signed up to our newsletter. Both of these options are also great ways to keep up with other similarly-minded charitable initiatives, so be sure to stay in the loop!</p>
